## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

This was my first real challenge using an API. Some notes:

- Create a file to simulate the data that comes from the API. That way, while testing, you don't have to continually call the API.
- Ran into a few issues with the map API. Had to "remove" the map every time the page is loaded and before fetching data.
- Stored `userInput` as an object in order to give it a "value" and "type". Assigned type based on some regex matching. I then generated the URL to fetch data with a ternary operator.

```js
let userInput = {
  value: document.getElementById("ip-domain-user-input").value,
  type: null,
};
if (userInput.value.match(/\d*\.\d*\.\d*\.\d*/)) {
  userInput.type = "ipAddress";
} else {
  userInput.type = "domain";
}

// if no user input => get default API value (which uses user's IP address as a default)
const url = userInput.value
  ? `https://geo.ipify.org/api/v1?apiKey=at_buolCeBWmSm37OCUs5M7VfDn6RD38&${userInput.type}=${userInput.value}`
  : "https://geo.ipify.org/api/v1?apiKey=at_buolCeBWmSm37OCUs5M7VfDn6RD38";
```

- handling errors...
